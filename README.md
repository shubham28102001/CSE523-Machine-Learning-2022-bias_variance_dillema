Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
<ul>
    <li>Heart Disease is a leading cause of death globally.</li>
    <li>At present, the key factor responsible for mortality is Heart Disease.</li>
    <li>More than ⅓ death occur due to heart disease problem.</li>
    <li>Smoking habits, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity are the factor causing heart disease.</li>
    <li>Machine learning is proven to be an efficient approach to predict the risk of heart disease using the large amount of data collected from the HealthCare Industry.</li>
</ul>
